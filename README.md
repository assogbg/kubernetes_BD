# Kubernetes training overview

This is a project thats presents, highlights and describes main features of kubernetes (k8s) for the purpose of Business & Decision data engineers. The major aim of this project is to allow you to earn theoretical AND technical knowledge in order to either implement a k8s project.

As a deep and developed k8s training, each section will first present the different concept, then show some examples through hands-on exercices based on **real client used cases**.

### PREREQUISITES

Some experience with a programming language (python, javascript, bash, ..) will be useful. Yet, we wrote this training while supposing that the attendees don't have any knowledge of kubernetes.

### Summary

Before diving in technical features and objects of kubernetes, it is important to quickly go through the introduction.

It describes the weaknesses of the old school software architecture that triggered the rise of a new paradigm, where kubernetes brilliantly fills most of the gaps.

**[FROM MONOLITH TO MICROSERVICES](introduction.md)**

With that in mind, the technical components and objects of a k8s cluster will make more sense.
This will give you some help you figure out the huge revolution that happened in the software industry over the last decade, which  

Note that the different sections have been thought, written and optimized to be followed in the sections order.
Here the different parts of this training:

2. **[DOCKER/NODE.js REMINDER](docker-image/reminder.md)**
3. **[PODS](1-PODS/pods.md)**
4. **[DEPLOYMENTS](2-DEPLOYMENTS/deployments.md)**
5. **[SERVICES](3-SERVICES/services.md)**
6. **[VOLUMES](4-VOLUMES/volumes.md)**
7. **[INGRESS](5-INGRESS/ingress.md)**
8. **[CONFIGMAPS](6-CONFIGMAPS/configmaps.md)**
9. **[SECRETS](7-SECRETS/secrets.md)**
10. **[MULTICONTAINERS](8-MULTICONTAINERS/multicontainers.md)**
11. **[HANDS-ON USE CASE](USE_CASES/usecases.md)**

Therefore, you will need to install locally kubernetes or use a cloud provider.
We will use minikube for all the exercices, please follow this installation tutorial: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/

We do recommend to use Linux or Mac for this training and we have not been able to test it on Windows. Sorry for that !

Once it's done you're ready to rock Kubernetes !
